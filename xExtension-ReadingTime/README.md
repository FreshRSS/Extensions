Extension for FressRSS (<https://github.com/FreshRSS>)

> **v1.6**

Add a reading time estimation next to each article.
Works on both desktop and mobile displays.

Install it the same way as any other extension, with the integrated tool in the interface (parameters icon -> extensions) or manually by copying this repository directly in the `extensions` folder of your FreshRSS install.
No external module. Once activated in the preferences, this extension should be working after reloading the page.

You can set reading speed and source metrics to estimate reading time.
