# xExtension-ShareByEmail

This FreshRSS extension allows to share articles by email, in a more powerful way than the simple `mailto` solution.

## How to install

To install this extension, you must upload this directory in your `./extensions` directory and enable it on the extension panel in FreshRSS.

## How to configure

After the installation the `Email` sharing service will added to the list of available sharing services. You need to add the `Email` sharing service to your individual sharing service list before it is available in the sharing menu.

You will have to configure the mailing system in FreshRSS. [See the documentation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/admins/05_Configuring_email_validation.html#configure-the-smtp-server)
